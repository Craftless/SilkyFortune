This mod makes Silk Touch and Fortune compatible with each other!

 

Due to how Minecraft loot tables work, using a pickaxe with both Silk Touch and Fortune (acquired from a command) results in the prioritisation of Silk Touch, thereby causing Fortune to not take effect.

 

With this mod, both Silk Touch and Fortune can be applied to pickaxes, resulting in ores dropping more of themselves.

 

This mod works with any other mod that adds ores, not just with vanilla ores.

 

Installation:

For Servers: Mod only needs to be on the server, clients do not need to install the mod.

Works for Singleplayer too.

 

Have fun breaking the economy!
